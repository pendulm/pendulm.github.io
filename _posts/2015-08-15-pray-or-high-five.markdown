Emoji ![pray](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/graphics/emojis/pray.png) is popular in social network, it express some miserable or good wish.

But, some news clarify it is a really a `High Five` attitude, so use it in catastrophes is rediculous. When I first read these news, I think it's a funny misunderstanding.

Until I find [this][1] Emoji cheet sheet, the Emoji code is `:pray:`. Then I googled for it, there is an convincing [article][2] about it.


So, the Internet is really a fucking choas.
