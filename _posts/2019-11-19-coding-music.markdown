I am a Coder, and my wife has a degree of Musicology, and I want my child have both skills.

Whatever learning music by coding or learning coding by music, I think it's a funny progress for childrenhood, and It's [said that][twitter] live-coding music is fit well for programming beginners.

There are a lot of project for music instrument by programming, enumerate some:
- [sonic-pi](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi)
- [supercollider](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/)
- [Sporth](https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/Sporth)
- [handel](https://handel-pl.github.io/)

and here even has a [awesome list](https://github.com/pjagielski/awesome-live-coding-music) of live coding music

I like to choose sonic-pi for my practice in this new world.
