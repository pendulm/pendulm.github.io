Here I would like to share my experience about cook `Pepper Fried Meat`, it's one of my favourite.

First ingredients, I bought half kilogram of streaky pork, some red hang Pepper, some ginger, I only use almost half of meat, but It still too more for one's dinner, and I miss green pepper, So the final dish looks a little ordinary.

Taught by [instructment](http://www.xiachufang.com/recipe/1010334/), I salted meat a while, but I gave too much salt, so it taste too salty, I guest salt shouldn't more then a teaspoon of.

Pepper fried first, extract fragrance from it, acompany with ginger, I made a mistake that take too much ginger and lack of garlic. Here is a useful tip, when you fring, first evaporate the water on the pan, otherwise water and oil would get scary blasting.

While seasoning fried well, you can put meat in the pan, and just stir up and turn over with high heat. I love meat taste a little burnt, so I deep fried.

This is my first experience with cook with meat, and the final dish is not too bad. I would take more practises.
